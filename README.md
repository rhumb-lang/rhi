`rhi` is the reference interpreter for Rhumb, an image-based, prototype-oriented
programming language designed to be English-language free.

This repository contains the core runtime (rhi), comprising the lexer, bytecode
compiler, and virtual machine.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Hisyeo/rhi.git
cd rhi

# Build the binary
go build -o bin/rhi ./cmd/rhi
```

## 🚀 Usage

You can run `rhi` in interactive mode (REPL) or execute scripts directly.

### Interactive Mode (REPL)

Running the binary without arguments starts the Read-Eval-Print Loop.

```console
$ ./bin/rhi
> x := 10
=> 10
> x ** 2
=> 20
```

### Running Scripts

Pass a file path to execute a Rhumb script.

```bash
./bin/rhi ./examples/chat.rh
```

### Command Line Flags

The CLI includes tracing tools for debugging the compiler and VM.

| Flag              | Description                                                                                                                         |
|:------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-test`           | **Test Mode.** Runs the script and validates assertions defined by the `%=` operator. Output is suppressed unless a failure occurs. |
| `-trace-bytecode` | **Compiler Trace.** Prints the disassembled bytecode chunks generated by the compiler before execution.                             |
| `-trace-stack`    | **Stack Trace.** Logs the state of the data stack after every instruction.                                                          |
| `-trace-space`    | **Realm Trace.** Logs actor-model events: Realm creation, Signal posting, Listener matching, and Bubbling.                          |
| `-trace-loader`   | **Loader Trace.** Logs library resolution events: Path lookup, version matching, and cycle detection.                               |

**Example: Debugging a script**

```console
$ ./bin/rhi -trace-stack -trace-space ./tests/sieve.rh
```

## ✅ Development Status: v0.3.0 (Library League)

The core language semantics are stable. The focus is now shifting from internal VM mechanics to the Standard Library and tooling.

### Changelog: v0.3.0

- [x] **Dates/Durations**: A literal type for working with dates and times (`2025/01/01`, `12:00:00`)
- [x] **Versions**: Builtin semver as a literal type (`1.0.0`, `1.2.-`)
- [x] **Decimals**: Builtin support for full precision decimal math (using `apd`)
- [x] **Resolvers**: Implementation of the import system (`{ resolver | path | version }`).
    - [x] **Standard Resolver (`!`)**: Imports from `RHUMB_LIB` (e.g. `{! | math | -}`)
    - [x] **Local Resolver (`-`)**: Imports from project source (e.g. `{- | libs/calc | -}`)
    - [x] **Catalogs**: Support for `project@.rhy` metadata and dependency aliasing
    - [x] **Cycle Detection**: Runtime detection of circular dependencies
    - [x] **Loader Tracing**: Added `-trace-loader` flag

### Core Features (Implemented previously)

- [x] **Syntax & Grammar**: Full ANTLR4 grammar for Maps, Selectors, and Operators
- [x] **Prototype Model**: Maps (`[...]`), Fields, inheritance (`@`), and mutable/immutable assignment
- [x] **Bytecode Compiler**: Single-pass incremental compiler with lexical scoping and variable hoisting
- [x] **Cactus Stack VM**: Heap-allocated call frames supporting closures (`<fn>`) and "Zombie" frame persistence
- [x] **Concurrency (The Tuplespace)**:
    - [x] Signals (`#`) bubbling up the realm hierarchy
    - [x] Replies (`^`) drilling down into Zombie frames
    - [x] Tuplespaces (`<$>`, `<|>`) and tuple lifecycle pattern-matching
    - [x] Selectors (`{}`) as pattern-matching listeners
- [x] **Control Flow**:
    - [x] Native operators (`=>`, `~>`, `|>`) compiling to jump instructions
    - [x] Pattern Matching (`..`, `::`)
- [x] **Testing Infrastructure**: Built-in assertion runner via the `-test` flag.

### Roadmap to v0.4

#### 🚧 Missing Grammar Support
- [ ] **Resolvers**:
    - [ ] **Remote/Git (`git`)**: Support for importing directly from git repositories.
- [ ] **Vassals `<{}>`**: Compilation of security proxies.
- [ ] **Keys `` ` ``**: Compilation of private capability keys.
- [ ] **Spread `&`**: Implementation of `[...]` list spreading and slurping.
- [ ] **Panic `***`**: Runtime support for fatal error literals.

#### 📚 Standard Library
- [ ] Implementation of the `math`, `io`, and `sys` libraries.

#### ⚡ Optimizations
- [ ] **Frame Pooling**: Reuse `CallFrame` structs to eliminate GC pressure during recursion (Targeting >5x speedup for `fib`).
- [ ] **Hidden Classes**: Implement the `Legend` transition tree to allow map schema sharing.
- [ ] **Inline Caching**: Cache field lookups in `OP_SEND` to achieve O(1) property access.
- [ ] **Dictionary Mode**: Fallback to Hash Maps for objects with large numbers of fields.

#### 🔮 Planned / Concept
- [ ] **The Freezer**: Serialization engine for persisting the Heap/Space to disk (`.ri` files).
- [ ] **RHIDE**: Wayland-native graphical IDE ("Code Projector").
- [ ] **Network Transparency**: Binding Realms to TCP/WebSocket sockets.

## 🧪 Testing

The interpreter includes a suite of tests. Tests are written in Rhumb itself using the `%=` assertion operator.

```rhumb
% Example Test
fib(10) %= 55
```

To run a test, use the `-test` flag:

```console
$ time ./bin/rhi -test ./tests/fib.rh
PASS: 9227465

real    0m11.726s
user    0m15.223s
sys     0m0.618s
```
