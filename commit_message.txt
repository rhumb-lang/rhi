fix(compiler, vm, loader): Support JSON data, indexing, and test deep retrieve

This commit addresses several issues and adds comprehensive support for loading and manipulating structured JSON data within Rhumb, particularly focusing on deep retrieval and dynamic indexing.

Key changes include:
- **Compiler - `OpIndex` Support**:
  - `internal/compiler/binary.go`: Implemented compilation for the `OpIndex` operator (`[]`), translating array/map access (e.g., `obj[key]`) into `OP_CALL` instructions. This enables dynamic lookup of elements within map and list structures.
- **VM - Dynamic Map/List Access**:
  - `internal/vm/primitives.go`: Extended the `opCall` instruction handler to support calling `mapval.Map` objects. When a map is called with a single argument, it performs a key lookup, treating the argument as the key. This allows `OP_CALL` to serve as the underlying mechanism for both function invocation and dynamic map/list indexing.
  - `opAssertEq`: Restored its intended behavior to strictly compare `expected.Str` with `actual.Canonical()`, aligning with the Rhumb testing philosophy where the expectation is the raw string content and the actual is its canonical representation.
- **Loader - JSON Number Conversion**:
  - `internal/loader/loader.go`: Enhanced `toRhumbValue` to correctly convert `float64` values (from JSON parsing) into `mapval.NewInt` if the float represents a whole number, ensuring type fidelity for integer values.
- **Loader - `SourceRoot` Path Resolution Fix**:
  - `internal/loader/loader.go`: Refined `resolvePath` logic to prevent double-appending `SourceRoot` (e.g., `src/src`) when the `ProjectRoot` might already include it, improving path resolution accuracy.
- **New Test Project - Deep JSON Retrieval**:
  - Added `tests/fixtures/deep_json/**`: A new comprehensive test project to validate the loading and deep retrieval of complex JSON structures.
    - Includes `deep_json@.rhy` catalog, versioned Rhumb test scripts (`+deep_retrieve.rh` for tip and 0.1.0 versions), and corresponding JSON data files.
    - `tests/fixtures/deep_json/src/[data]/[data]@.rhy`: Created the resource catalog for the `data` resource shelf.
    - `tests/fixtures/deep_json/src/[data]/0.1.0/deep.json` and `src/[data]/-/deep.json`: JSON data files, including version-specific content to test differential loading.
    - The `src/data` folder in the fixture was renamed to `src/[data]` to align with the bracketed protocol for resource shelves.

These changes collectively enable robust handling of structured data within Rhumb, allowing for flexible and type-safe access to JSON fields and array elements.
