% Space Operations Test 1 (Reply Value)

dummy := [] -> (
    res := #ping % sends out a signal directly into the subroutine's space
    % dummy will be a zombie frame until a reply is received
    res % return the value, once received
)

result1 := dummy { % we are now subscribing to events from inside of dummy's subspace
  #ping .. ^pong('hello') % if we receive a ping, reply with pong directly back into the zombie frame
} % dummy was a zombie frame but pong revived from the attached selector but the selector doesn't have any pattern
% for matching regular return values so it just passes through into the resul1 label

result1 %= 'hello'

% Space Operations Test 2 (Multiple Reply Values)

result2 := dummy { % we are now subscribing to events from inside of dummy's subspace
  #ping .. ^pong('hello'; 'world') % if we receive a ping, reply with pong directly back into the zombie frame
}

result2 %= ['hello'; 'world']
result2\1 %= 'hello'
result2\2 %= 'world'
